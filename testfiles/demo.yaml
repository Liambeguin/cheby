            Shows which interrupts are enabled. 1 means that the interrupt associated with the bitfield is enabled

            Each bit represents the state of corresponding interrupt. 1 means the interrupt is pending. Writing 1 to a bit clears the corresponding interrupt. Writing 0 has no effect.
