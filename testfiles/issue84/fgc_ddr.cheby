  comment: "As the information is provided by the firmware the value is read during runtime by the FESA class. But beforehand the according fgc_ddr submap nees to be placed and sized exactly the same way as in the firmware!\n\n\nThe ident provided is a pseudo ident because this map does not provide any real register but a chunk of DDR memory. Thus the data cannot be read back from the hardware."
