# Extensions

In december 2019, we decided to add versioning for the schema of the
core specifications and for the schema of the extensions.

The schema version is defined using semantic versioning.

The current extensions are described in the following sections.

## x-hdl

## x-gena

## x-fesa

## x-driver-edge

## x-cern-info

## x-wbgen

## x-devicetree

## x-interrupts
